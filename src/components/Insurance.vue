        I do not participate as in network provider for insurance plans. There was a lot of thought that went into making this decision.
        It is my desire to protect your confidentiality so your diagnosis does not remain a permanent part of your medical records. Insurance
        Insurance companies can also require records reviews and obtain my private session notes and given the sensitive topics discussed
        it is my desire to protect your confidentiality.
      </p>
      <p class="mx-auto mt-5 max-w-xl text-xl text-gray-500">
        In addition to concerns, insurance companies dictate the length and frequency of our sessions. This can add unnecessary pressure
        and constraints and hinder your recovery. I want you to be in charge of your therapy, not a 3<sup>rd</sup> pary.
